# javascript-quiz

# Description
This quiz was made to test bootcamp students like me on their JavaScript knowledge, while testing my knowledge at the same time by building this quiz.

# References
I referenced questions from W3Schools' JavaScript quiz: https://www.w3schools.com/quiztest/quiztest.asp?qtest=JS to create my quiz questions. I also used the help of GreatStack on YouTube to solve bugs and learn new tips.
